    <tr>

           <td style="font-size:25px">Most of our energy use comes from fossil fuels like petroleum and coal that provide electricity and gas to power our growing energy needs. These resources are non-renewable which means that we will eventually run out. Conserving energy not only helps to conserve resources but also translates into financial savings. When we drive our cars, wash our hands and turn lights on, we usually don’t stop to assess the amount of resources we are using. We also don’t stop to think that we are depleting resources that are not boundless. We can all conserve energy, save money, reduce environmental pollution and improve the quality of our campus.</td>

<!--This is the subpage HOW - methods to conserve energy-->
<h1><a name="HOW">How?</a></h1>
<ol type='1'; style="font-style:bold">
<li><met_head>Using Home Appliances</met_head>
<br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Set your clothes washer to the warm or cold water setting, not hot. Switching from hot to warm for two loads per week can save nearly 500 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</li>
          <li>Make sure your dishwasher is full when you run it and use the energy saving setting. You can also turn off the drying cycle manually. Not using heat in the drying cycle can save 20 percent of your dishwasher's total electricity use.</li>
          <li>Select the most energy-efficient models when you replace your old appliances. Look for the Energy Star Label - your assurance that theproduct saves energy and prevents pollution.</li>
       </ol>           </font>
</li>
<br>
<li><met_head>Home Heating and Cooling</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Be careful not to overheat or overcool rooms.Lowering your thermostat just two degrees during winter saves 6 percent of heating-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. That's a reduction of 420 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per year for a typical home.</li>
          <li>Clean or replace air filters as recommended. Energy is lost when air conditioners and hot-air furnaces have to work harder to draw air through dirty filters. Cleaning a dirty air conditioner filter can save 5 percent of the energy used. That could save 175 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</li>
       </ol>           </font>
</li>
<br>
<li><met_head>Small investments that pay off</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>By far the most energy efficient, the cleanest and most eco-friendly way of illumination is LED lighting, which is basically digital light and comes with a multitude of amazing benefits.</li>
          <li>Low-flow fixtures that conserve water are available for your shower, faucets and toilets. Every drop of water that you save contributes to conservation of this valuable resource.</li>
          <li>Saving energy conserves valuable resources and saves money. Do your part to make energy conservation a habit; it's a move with positive implications for both the environment and your wallet.</li>
       </ol>           </font>
</li>
<br>
<li><met_head>Getting around</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Whenever possible, walk, bike, car pool, or use mass transit. Every gallon of gasoline you save avoids 22 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. If your car gets 25 miles per gallon, for example, and you reduce your annual driving from 12,000 to 10,000 miles, you'll save 1800 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
          <li>When you next buy a car, choose one that gets good mileage. If your new car gets 40 miles per gallon instead of 25, and you drive 10,000 miles per year, you'll reduce your annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 3,300 pounds.</li>
       </ol>           </font>
</li>
<br>
<li><met_head>Reduce, reuse, recycle</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Reduce the amount of waste you produce by buying minimally packaged goods, choosing reusable products over disposable ones, and recycling. For every pound of waste you eliminate or recycle, you save energy and reduce emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> by at least 1 pound. Cutting down your garbage by half of one large trash bag per week saves at least 1100 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Making products with recycled materials, instead of from scratch with raw materials, uses 30 to 55% less for paper products, 33% less for glass, and a whopping 90% less for aluminum.</li>
          <li>If your car has an air conditioner, make sure its coolant is recovered and recycled whenever you have it serviced. In the United States, leakage from auto air conditioners is the largest single source of emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which damage the ozone layer as well as add to global warming. The CFCs from one auto air conditioner can add the equivalent of 4800 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year.</li>
       </ol>           </font>
</li>
<br>
<li><met_head>Home Improvements</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Modernize your windows. Replacing all your ordinary windows with argon filled, double-glazed windows saves 2.4 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year for homes with gas heat, 3.9 tons of oil heat, and 9.8 tons for electric heat.</li>
	  <li>Plant shade trees and paint your house a light color if you live in a warm climate, or a dark color if you live in a cold climate. Reductions in energy use resulting from shade trees and appropriate painting can save up to 2.4 tons of CO2 emissions per year. (Each tree also directly absorbs about 25 pounds of CO2 from the air annually.)</li>
	  <li>Insulate your walls and ceilings. This can save 20 to 30 percent of home heating bills and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 140 to 2100 pounds per year. If you live in a colder climate, consider superinsulating. That can save 5.5 tons of CO2 per year for gas-heated homes, 8.8 tons per year for oil heat, or 23 tons per year for electric heat. (If you have electric heat, you might also consider switching to more efficient gas or oil.)</li>

<br>
<li><met_head>Business and community</met_head><br>
       <ol type='i'>   <font size=5>
          <li>Work with your employer to implement these and other energy-efficiency and waste-reduction measures in your office or workplace. Form or join local citizens' groups and work with local government officials to see that these measures are taken in schools and public buildings.</li>
          <li>Keep track of the environmental voting records of candidates for office. Stay abreast of environmental issues on both local and national levels, and write or call your elected officials to express your concerns about energy efficiency and global warming.</li>
